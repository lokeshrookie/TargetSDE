1. BubbleSort:
         1. we need to compare current element with next element and swap if it is larger
         2. outer-loop iterates over all the indexes.
         3. inner-loop iterates till arr.length-1.
         4. we can optimise this by iterating till arr.length-1-i. becasue,
            the arr.length-i element is already in its correct position.
